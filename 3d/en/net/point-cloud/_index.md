Developers can easily generate point clouds from 3D files using the 3D library. Few formats supported by the API are WavefrontOBJ, Discreet3DS, STL (ASCII, Binary), FBX (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, Collada, GLB, glTF, PLY, DirectX, Google Draco formats, etc. The generation process is very simple, load the source file through the instance of the [scene class](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed/scene), use some methods of the 3D library, and call with the relevant output The Save method of the format parameter.

Developers can easily create 3d point cloud files through the same process listed above. Consider some examples like **3DS to PLY point cloud**. Load 3DS files via scene class objects. Create save options using [PLYSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/plySaveOptions) to create save options and call the scene save method with the output file path and ply options arguments. The API has appropriate options classes for saving into related classes, e.g. [A3dwSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/a3dwsaveoptions) [AmfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/amfsaveoptions) [Discreet3dsSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/discreet3dssaveoptions) [Html5SaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/html5saveoptions) [RvmSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats/rvmsaveoptions) and more. Here is the full list of 3D [point cloud formats](https://apireference.aspose.com/3d/net/aspose.threed.formats) options.
