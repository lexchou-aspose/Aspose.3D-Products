 In order to merge RVM file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with merge any 3D file. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to merge the RVM file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Merge multiple RVM files by looping
-  After merging, a usdz file is generated, waiting for download processing
-  Load the generated usdz file through the constructor of the Scene class
-  Process usdz files and save them in the format you want

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.
