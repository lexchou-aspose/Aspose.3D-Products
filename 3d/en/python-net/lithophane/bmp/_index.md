 In order to create your lithophane from BMP file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net)
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with create your lithophane. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to create your lithophane from the BMP file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Create some new parameters and create a Mesh object
-  Perform computational operations on Mesh objects
-  BMP file loads 3d scene through Mesh class
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for Python API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent bitmap image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
