 In order to convert ATT to RVM, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python via .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for Python. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.3D 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Python programmers can easily load & convert ATT files to RVM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load ATT file via the from_file of Scene class
1.  Create an instance of AmfSaveOptions
1.  Set RVM specific properties for advanced conversion
1.  Call the Scene.save method
1.  Pass the output path with RVM file extension & object of RvmSaveOptions
1.  Check resultant RVM file at specified path
