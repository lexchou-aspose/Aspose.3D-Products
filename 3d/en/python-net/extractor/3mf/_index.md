 In order to extract assets from 3MF file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with extract assets. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to extract assets from the 3MF file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load 3MF file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Create zip file format object as output file format
-  Create archive class and handle extract asset class
-  Call the Extract method and save the file

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for Python API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="3MF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/3mf/" >}}
3MF, 3D manufacturing format, is used by applications to render 3D object models to a variety of other applications, platforms, services and printers. It was built to avoid the limitations and issues in other 3D file formats, like STL, for working with the latest versions of 3D printers. 3MF is relatively a new file format that has been developed and published by the 3MF consortium.
