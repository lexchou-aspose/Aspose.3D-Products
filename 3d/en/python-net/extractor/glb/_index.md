 In order to extract assets from GLB file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.3D for Python](https://products.aspose.com/3d/python-net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for Python platform to be used with extract assets. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to extract assets from the GLB file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load GLB file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Create zip file format object as output file format
-  Create archive class and handle extract asset class
-  Call the Extract method and save the file

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for Python API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GLB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/glb/" >}}
GLB is the binary file format representation of 3D models saved in the GL transmission format (glTF). Information about 3D models such as node hierarchy, cameras, materials, animations and meshes in binary format. This binary format stores the glTF asset (JSON, .bin and images) in a binary blob. It also avoids the issue of increase in file size which happens in case of glTF. GLB file format results in compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, and extensibility for further development. The format uses model/gltf-binary as MIME type.
