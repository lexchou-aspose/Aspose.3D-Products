 In order to watermark JT file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with add any watermark. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to add blind watermark to the JT file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load JT file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add watermark and password using Aspose.3D's EncodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# code to Add Blind Watermark to JT" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

//The source file that needs to be watermarked and the output file after saving
string file = "template.jt";
string output =System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".fbx";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);

//Add watermark and password to files
var numMeshes = 0;
scene.RootNode.Accept((Node node) =>
{
    var mesh = node.GetEntity<Mesh>();
    if (mesh != null)
    {
        numMeshes++;
        mesh = Watermark.EncodeWatermark(mesh, "HelloWorld", "1234");
        if (mesh != null)
        {
            node.Entity = mesh;
        }
    }
    return true;
});

//Save the file in the format you want
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.
