 In order to watermark 3DS file, we’ll use
 [Aspose.3D for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/3d/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use API for C# platform to be used with add any watermark. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.3d) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.3D** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.3D makes it easy for the developers to add blind watermark to the 3DS file with just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Load 3DS file via the constructor of Scene class
-  Get the mesh class of Aspose.3D
-  Add watermark and password using Aspose.3D's EncodeWatermark method
-  Call the Scene.Save method with object

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C# code to Add Blind Watermark to 3DS" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

//The source file that needs to be watermarked and the output file after saving
string file = "template.3ds";
string output =System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".fbx";

// create an instance of Scene
Scene scene = new Scene(file);

//Add watermark and password to files
var numMeshes = 0;
scene.RootNode.Accept((Node node) =>

    var mesh = node.GetEntity<Mesh>();
    if (mesh != null)

        numMeshes++;
        mesh = Watermark.EncodeWatermark(mesh, "HelloWorld", "1234");

});

//Save the file in the format you want
scene.Save(output, FileFormat.FBX7400ASCII);

    {{% blocks/products/pf/agp/content h2="About Aspose.3D for .NET API" %}}

 Aspose.3D is a CAD and Gameware API to load, modify and convert 3D files. API is a standalone and does not require any any 3D modeling or rendering software. One can easily use API for Discreet3DS, WavefrontOBJ, STL (ASCII, Binary), Universal3D, FBX (ASCII, Binary), Collada, glTF, PLY, GLB, DirectX and more formats.

A file with 3DS extension represents 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk 3D Studio. Autodesk 3D Studio has been in 3D file format market since 1990s and has now evolved to 3D Studio MAX for working with 3D modeling, animation and rendering. A 3DS file contains data for 3D representation of scenes and images and is one of the popular file formats for 3D data import and export. It considers information like camera locations, Mesh data, lighting information, viewport configurations, smoothing group data, bitmap references and attributes to create vertices and polygons for rendering a scene.
